Leetcode Question 5: Longest Palindromic Substring
Given a string s, find the longest palindromic substring in s. You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.

Possible Solution:
1, reverse the string and compare it with the original string so that we can find the longest substring which may be the answer.
However, considering the example:S = “abacdfgdcaba”; S=“abacdfgdcaba”. In this case, the longest substring is 'abacd' which is not a palindromic string.
Therefore, we need to modify this solution to meet the requirement.

2, Brute-force, but the time complexity may be O(n^3)
